Comments:

Cities are ordered from lowest to highest adjusted OR. Across the 47
cities, the adjusted odds ratios comparing male to female victims are
below 1 in most cities, meaning homicides with male victims have lower
odds of being solved than those with female victims after adjusting for
victim age and race. It indicates that homicides with male victims are
less likely to be solved than those with female victims. A few cities
have ORs near or above 1, but many of those have wide confidence
intervals that include 1, suggesting a lot of uncertainty.

## Problem 2

Load and clean data.

``` r
set.seed(1)

data("weather_df")

weather_df =
  weather_df |>
  drop_na(tmax, tmin, prcp)
```

Define a function.

``` r
boot_stats = function(df) {
  fit = lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = df)
  
  g = broom::glance(fit)
  t = broom::tidy(fit)

    pull(estimate)
  
  tibble(
    r_squared  = g$r.squared,
    beta_ratio = beta_tmin / beta_prcp

Description:

The bootstrap histograms show the sampling distributions of both
r_squared and the coefficient ratio beta_tmin / beta_prcp and based on
5000 resamples of the weather data.

The distribution of r_squared is tightly concentrated, indicating that
the linear model consistently explains a large proportion of the
variation in daily maximum temperature. The histogram is approximately
unimodal and narrow, suggesting that the estimate of model fit is very
stable across bootstrap samples.

In contrast, the distribution of the coefficient ratio beta_tmin /
beta_prcp is much more dispersed and shows greater variability. This
reflects the fact that the estimated effect of precipitation on maximum
temperature is small, leading to instability when dividing by a
coefficient close to zero. As a result, the ratio exhibits a wider and
more skewed distribution.

Identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles.

``` r
boot_results |>
  summarise(
    r2_low     = quantile(r_squared, 0.025),
    r2_high    = quantile(r_squared, 0.975),
    ratio_low  = quantile(beta_ratio, 0.025),
    ratio_high = quantile(beta_ratio, 0.975)
  )

Description of modeling process:

I selected predictors for birthweight based on known clinical factors
that influence fetal growth. Variables reflecting the baby’s size
(length, head circumference), gestational age, maternal characteristics
(age, BMI, weight gain, parity), smoking during pregnancy, and basic
demographics (sex, mother’s race) were included because they have clear
biological or empirical links to birthweight. I fit a linear regression
using these predictors and then assessed model assumptions by plotting
residuals versus fitted values using add_predictions() and
add_residuals(), confirming that residuals were approximately centered
with no major patterns.

Compare my model to two others.

``` r
# Define the three functions
model_mine <- function(df) lm(
  bwt ~ gaweeks + blength + bhead +
    babysex + mrace +
    momage + ppbmi + smoken + wtgain + parity,
  data = df
)

model_len_gaw <- function(df) lm(
  bwt ~ blength + gaweeks,
  data = df
)

model_head_len_sex <- function(df) lm(
  bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex,
  data = df
)

# RMSE function
rmse <- function(model, data) {
  preds <- predict(model, newdata = data)
  sqrt(mean((data$bwt - preds)^2))

Using cross-validation, the proposed multivariable model had the lowest
mean RMSE, indicating better out-of-sample prediction of birthweight
than the simpler length + gestational age model and the three-way
interaction model. The interaction model tended to have larger and more
variable RMSE, likely reflecting overfitting due to its greater
complexity.
